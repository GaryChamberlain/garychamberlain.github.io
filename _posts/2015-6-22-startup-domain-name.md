So, you have a start up and need a domain name?  Well, yes, if you have a start up you need a good domain name.  What does that mean?  What exactly makes one good? Is it possible these days to get a good one on a limited budget?  How much should you pay?  In this article I'll cover these questions and more.

## Domain Name Basics

Domain names consist of two or more phrases, each separated by a period. The domain name `example.com` uses the _com_ top level domain (a.k.a. TLD) and a second-level domain _example_.  There are a handful of common TLDs that have been around for a very long time, such as .com, .net, .org, .edu, .mil, and so forth.  These are termed general top level domains, or gTLD for short.  Each was created to server a particular purpose, such as .com for commercial, .edu for education, etc. Each gTLD is three or more characters. 

Some gTLDs have strict rules, and only allow particular kinds of organizations to register a second level domain, such as .mil and .edu. Others are much more flexible, and available on a first come first served basis. For example, it's perfectly acceptable for a non-profit company to register and use a .com domain, and a for profit corporation to register and use a .org domain.
