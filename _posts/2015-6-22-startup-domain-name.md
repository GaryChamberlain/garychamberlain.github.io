So, you have a start up and need a domain name?  Well, yes, if you have a start up you need a good domain name.  What exactly makes one _good_? Is it possible these days to get a good one on a limited budget?  How much should you pay?  In this article I'll cover these questions and more.

## Domain Name Basics

The domain `example.com` uses the _com_ top level domain (a.k.a. TLD) and _example_ as a second-level domain.  The .com TLD is one of a handful of common TLDs which have been around for a very long time. Others include .net, .org, .edu, .gov, and so forth.  These are termed generic top level domains, or gTLDs for short.  Each was created to serve a particular purpose, such as .com for commercial or .edu for education. Each gTLD is three or more characters. 

Some gTLDs have strict rules, and only allow particular kinds of organizations to register a second level domain, such as .mil and .edu. Others are much more flexible, and available on a first come first served basis. For example, it's perfectly acceptable for a non-profit company to register and use a .com domain, and a for-profit corporation to register and use a .org domain.

### Two-Letter Domains

You might have also seen two letter domains, like .us, .me, .co, and so on.  All two-letter domains belong to a country.  These are known as country code top level domains, or ccTLDs for short.  While it is possible to build your business around a website with a ccTLD, it is very important for you to understand the risks and issues than can come with it.

Firstly, the rules for a particular domain are entirely in the purview of the associated country.  The country can choose to change pricing, add regulations and requirements, revoke your domain if you break their laws, or anything else. Basing your company website on a ccTLD is, to some degree, tying your business to that country.

Secondly, since countries are regional within the world, there are search engine optimization (SEO) issues.  For instance, Google might be less likely to serve a .de website to a person in America than a .us domain.  If you conduct business primarily in Germany, a .de domain might be perfect for you. If not, consider a different TLD.

### General ccTLDs

There are some ccTLDs that have been marketed to be generic, and have gained worldwide traction.  For instance, while the .me domain is for the country Montenegro, many people in other countries register them for personal use.  The .co domain (columbia) has been marketed as the _new .com_ and has become popular for general use.  Similarly, the .io domain (British Indian Ocean Territory) is very popular for technology websites.

Google, and perhaps other search engines, recognize this and choose on a case-by-case basis which ccTLDs are considered generic.  These ones are safe to use from an SEO perspective.

### New Domains

Until recently, it was difficult and expensive to get a decent domain name.  There just weren't enough of them, so the good ones were either already in use or being squatted on by those seeking an easy pay day. That's changing!  There has been an explosion of new top level domains, with more coming all the time.  The act of referring to a website as a "dot com" will be relegated to an anachronism over the coming years.  So, there's no need to worry about having that perfect .com domain, or pay an exhoritant amount for one.


## Good Names

Wouldn't it be great to have a short, one word dot com domain name.  Yes, it would.  However, unless you have a ton of money, it's probably not going to happen.  You can probably get a good one or two word domain with a new TLD that is specific to your industry.  That would be a good choice.

### Your Own Domain

It is important to get your own domain name.  Service providers would love for you to use a subdomain of theirs, such as yourcompany.theircompany.com. Using a domain like that locks you into their service.  You can't take that domain with you. It will be more difficult for your customers to find you if you change providers, and you will lose all of your search engine page rank.  Using your own domain name enables the option to change providers.  Plus, you can have an email address on your own domain name, which appears more professional to your customers.

### Multiple Domains

Should you get multiple domains related to your business and stockpile them?  Of course, that's up to you.  To be clear, pointing multiple domains at your one website does not help your search engine rankings, and can harm them if the search engine recognizes duplicate content.

Here are some reasons why you might get and hold an additional domains.

1. You are planning on using it for a specific website or web application.
2. It represents a brand and you want it to _redirect_ to a section of your website.
3. It represents a word that you think someone might hand-type and want it to _redirect_ to your website.
4. It is common misspelling of your brand and want it to _redirect_ to your website.  Note that this can be pricey and is usually not worth it, unless you're a big company with a big budget.
5. You think it is valuable and want to hold on to it in case someone wants to buy it from you some day.  Note that while this still happens quite a bit, the resale value of most domains has dropped quite a bit and will continue to do so due to the flood of new top level domains.
6. You just think it's cool and want it.  Sure, that's reasonable. You like it and might find a good use for it later.

Note that the word _redirect_ is used a lot in this list.  It can really hurt your SEO to point lots of domains at your website, unless they are configured to send a permantent redirection header or canonocial link.  In that case, the extra domain has no SEO value.   

Generally speaking, get one good domain name and stick with it.
