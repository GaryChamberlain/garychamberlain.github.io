So, you have a start up and need a domain name?  Well, yes, if you have a start up you need a good domain name.  What does that mean?  What exactly makes one _good_? Is it possible these days to get a good one on a limited budget?  How much should you pay?  In this article I'll cover these questions and more.

## Domain Name Basics

Domain names consist of two or more phrases, each separated by a period. The domain name `example.com` uses the _com_ top level domain (a.k.a. TLD) and a second-level domain _example_.  There are a handful of common TLDs that have been around for a very long time, such as .com, .net, .org, .edu, .mil, and so forth.  These are termed general top level domains, or gTLD for short.  Each was created to server a particular purpose, such as .com for commercial, .edu for education, etc. Each gTLD is three or more characters. 

Some gTLDs have strict rules, and only allow particular kinds of organizations to register a second level domain, such as .mil and .edu. Others are much more flexible, and available on a first come first served basis. For example, it's perfectly acceptable for a non-profit company to register and use a .com domain, and a for profit corporation to register and use a .org domain.

### Two-Letter Domains

You might have also seen two letter domains, like .us, .me, .co, and so on.  All two-letter domains belong to a country.  These are known as country code top level domains, or ccTLDs for short.  While it is possible to build your business around a website with a ccTLD, it is very important for you to understand the risks and issues than can come with it.

Firstly, the rules for a particular domain are entirely in the purview of the associated country.  The country can choose to change pricing, add regulations and requirements, and so forth. Basing your company website on a particular ccTLD is, in effect, tying your business to that country.

Secondly, since countries are regional within the world, there are search engine optimization (SEO) issues.  For instance, Google might be less likely to serve a .de website to a person in America than a .us domain.  If you conduct business primarily in Germany, though, then a .de domain might be perfect for you.
