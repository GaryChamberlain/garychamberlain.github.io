So, you have a start up and need a domain name?  Well, yes, if you have a start up you need a good domain name.  What does that mean?  What exactly makes one _good_? Is it possible these days to get a good one on a limited budget?  How much should you pay?  In this article I'll cover these questions and more.

## Domain Name Basics

The domain `example.com` uses the _com_ top level domain (a.k.a. TLD) and _example_ as a second-level domain.  The .com TLD is one of a handful of common TLDs which have been around for a very long time. Others include .net, .org, .edu, .gov, and so forth.  These are termed generic top level domains, or gTLDs for short.  Each was created to serve a particular purpose, such as .com for commercial, .edu for education, etc. Each gTLD is three or more characters. 

Some gTLDs have strict rules, and only allow particular kinds of organizations to register a second level domain, such as .mil and .edu. Others are much more flexible, and available on a first come first served basis. For example, it's perfectly acceptable for a non-profit company to register and use a .com domain, and a for-profit corporation to register and use a .org domain.

### Two-Letter Domains

You might have also seen two letter domains, like .us, .me, .co, and so on.  All two-letter domains belong to a country.  These are known as country code top level domains, or ccTLDs for short.  While it is possible to build your business around a website with a ccTLD, it is very important for you to understand the risks and issues than can come with it.

Firstly, the rules for a particular domain are entirely in the purview of the associated country.  The country can choose to change pricing, add regulations and requirements, and so forth. Basing your company website on a ccTLD is, to some degree, tying your business to that country.

Secondly, since countries are regional within the world, there are search engine optimization (SEO) issues.  For instance, Google might be less likely to serve a .de website to a person in America than a .us domain.  If you conduct business primarily in Germany, a .de domain might be perfect for you. IF not, consider a different TLD.

### General ccTLDs

There are some ccTLDs that have been marketed to be generic, and have gained worldwide traction.  For instance, while the .me domain is for the country Montenegro, many people in other countries register them for personal use.  The .co domain (columbia) has been marketed as the _new .com_ and has become popular for general use.  Similarly, the .io domain (British Indian Ocean Territory) is very popular for technology websites.

Google, and perhaps other search engines, recognize this and choose on a case-by-case basis which ccTLDs are considered generic.  These ones are safe to use from an SEO perspective.

### New Domains

Until recently, it was difficult and expensive to get a decent domain name.  There just weren't enought of them, so the good ones were either already in use or being squatted on by those seeking an easy pay day. That's all changing, though!  There has been an explosion of new top level domains, with more coming all the time.  The association of the phrase "dot com" with websites will be relegated to an anachronism over the coming years.  So, there's no need to worry about having that perfect .com domain, or pay an exhoritant amount for one.
