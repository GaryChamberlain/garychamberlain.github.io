title: Comparison of Animation Libraries

The various JavaScript libraries take different approaches and have varying sets of features. How does one determine which to use? I figured it would be a great exercise to use many of the common tools, build the exact same animation and show how it's done.

I wanted a simple animation so that the examples are easy to read and understand. However, I didn't want it to be so tedious as to not be interesting. It glides a ball back and forth on the X axis, using SIN wave easing, over two seconds. Simultaneously, the ball is in a container that is steadily rotating clock-wise at one revolution every eight seconds. This emits a pleasing, albeit simple, spiral pattern.
