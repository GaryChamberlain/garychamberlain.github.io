Got a startup and need a website?  If you're not overly technical, it might be a little daunting.  I'll cover the basics and hopefully help you get started.

You'll need [a domain name](/startup-domain-name/).  Plus, you should start thinking about what [features](/your-website-platform/) you'll want your website to have. 

## Serving Content

What happens when you point your web browser at a website? The simplest way to think about it is to compare it a directory on your local computer.  There are files, each with content.  Some may be in subdirectories.  Web files are written as [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/). You probably don't want to write files like that, though.  Luckily, there are great tools that you can use.  [Let me Google that for you](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=free+html+editor).

While it is certainly possible to create a website with just a bunch of files, it is more common for a web server to run a program that listens for requests and figures out what to send back to the browser on-the-fly.  This way, the program can do things such as read a database and insert user specific content into the page.  Most websites are programs, but remember that they don't have to be.

Web server programs can be written in a variety of programming languages.  If you hear terms like Ruby on Rails, Java, C#, .NET, PHP, JavaScript, Node and so on, those are just programming languages used by to create the HTML on-the-fly.  Which language is the best?  It depends on whom you ask. That question is about on par with asking a bunch of people, "what is the best color?" 


## Content Management Systems

Programmers are expensive. If you want to hire a programmer to write a custom website application for you, prepare to pay a lot.  Luckily, there are some great programs already written that you can use.  Many of them are free!  Some of the most popular ones are [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).  There are many others.

Unless you have a specific need to develop a custom application, you should probably use one of these.  All of these are very extensible.  They have marketplaces that provide free and affordable extensions.  Plus, if you need to, you can hire a software developer to develop just the extension that you need, and not pay them for all the other stuff that comes by default.
