Got a startup and need a website?  If you're not overly technical, it might be a little daunting.  I'll cover the basics and hopefully help you get started.

You'll need [a domain name](/startup-domain-name/).  Plus, you should start thinking about what [features](/your-website-platform/) you'll want your website to have. 

## Serving Content

What happens when you point your web browser at a website? The simplest way to think about it is to compare it a directory on your local computer.  There are files, each with content.  Some may be in subdirectories.  Web files are written as [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/). You probably don't want to write files like that, though.  Luckily, there are great tools that you can use.  [Let me Google that for you](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=free+html+editor).

While it is certainly possible to create a website with just a bunch of files, it is more common for a web server to run a program that listens for requests and figures out what to send back to the browser on-the-fly.  This way, the program can do things such as read a database and insert user specific content into the page.  Most websites are programs, but remember that they don't have to be.

Web server programs can be written in a variety of programming languages.  If you hear terms like Ruby on Rails, Java, C#, .NET, PHP, JavaScript, Node and so on, those are just programming languages used by to create the HTML on-the-fly.  Which language is the best?  It depends on whom you ask. That question is about on par with asking a bunch of people, "what is the best color?" 


## Content Management Systems

Programmers are expensive. If you want to hire a programmer to write a custom website application for you, prepare to pay a lot.  Luckily, there are some great programs already written that you can use.  Many of them are free!  Some of the most popular ones are [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).  There are many others.

Unless you have a specific need to develop a custom application, you should probably use one of these.  All of these are very extensible.  They have marketplaces that provide free and affordable extensions.  Plus, if you need to, you can hire a software developer to develop just the extension that you need, and not pay them for all the other stuff that comes by default.


## Custom Service Providers

There are companies out there that provide _website services_. You create an account with them, use their tools, and _poof_, you have a website. They try to make it simple. I recommend you avoid services like this for reasons that include the following.

### Lock-in

These companies usually have proprietary solutions.  While they might say they have an export feature, it's not in their best interest to make it easy for you to leave.  Be especially weary if you need to use a domain name based on theirs.  You cannot take that with you.

### Limited Features

While some of these tools might have a lot of features, they are usually not pluggable or extensible.  You get what you get.  They provide the set of features that they can market well.  If they do have extensibility, you usually have to pay extra.

### Expensive

They'll advertise a cheap price.  However, you usually don't get a lot for that price. _e.g. $5 per month for a whopping 5 pages!_


## Hosting WordPress et al

While tools like WordPress are free, you still need to put them someplace online.  As a startup, you probably shouldn't need to pay more thatn $10 a month.  If you use standard software like WordPress, you can easily move it to a more capable (more expensive) server _when you need to_.

Consider popular providers such as [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/) or [HostGator](http://www.hostgator.com/).


### Free Hosting

If you don't need a database, or a program running on the server, there are some free options.  If you're willing to roll your sleeves up and learn a few tools, you can host a website for free. 

For example, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a completely free solution for hosting static web pages. Hundreds of thousands of websites are hosted there. Large companies like Google, Microsoft and IBM use them for some of their sites, and the U.S. government uses GitHub pages to host sites like whitehouse.gov. If you're willing to take the time to learn tools like [Markdown](http://whatismarkdown.com/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/), you can make great websites for free, and [they can look very good](https://www.google.com/#q=free+jekyll+themes).
