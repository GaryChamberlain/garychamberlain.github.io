Many new entrepreneurs know they need a website.  When asked, they will state it as one of their early objectives.  What does that mean?  When asked, they might say something like, "_so my customers can find me_" or "_so I can sell stuff._"  Those are perfectly valid responses, but might be too limited.  In fact, your website could be much more.

## What do you want your website to do?

Every business has different needs. The way that you want to engage with your customers will probably be a bit different than someone in a another industry. Regardless, there are many well established features that can used. Furthermore, there are often pluggable implementations to get you started quickly.

Consider the following list.  Some of these might be good for your company, and some just aren't. Some might be a good choice, but just not right away.  Think of your website as a platform, that is geared to help your customers, and to help you engage with them. Then, pick features such as those in this list to transform your website into a tool that serves those goals.

**Info about you**  | Of course almost every website will have this. Consider adding your name, phone number and other contact info, social media links, a map to your business, and your experience.
**Info about your offerings**  | What products and services do you offer?
**Sell your stuff**| You can integrate a store right into your website, or link to a third part service.
**Content** | What information would your customers find interesting?  Meaty and meaningful information is a great way to drive potential customers to your website, because search engines might correlate their search queries with your content.
