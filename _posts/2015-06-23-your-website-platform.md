Many new entrepreneurs know they need a website.  When asked, they will state it as one of their early objectives.  What does that mean?  When asked, they might say something like, "_so my customers can find me_" or "_so I can sell stuff._"  Those are perfectly valid responses, but might be too limited.  In fact, your website could be much more.

## What do you want your website to do?

Every business has different needs. The way that you want to engage with your customers will probably not be the same as someone in a another industry. Regardless, there are many well established features that can be used. Furthermore, there are often pluggable implementations to get you started quickly.

Consider the following list.  Some of these might be good for your company, and some just aren't. Some might be a good choice, but just not right away.  Think of your website as a platform, that is geared to help your customers, and to help you engage with them. Then, pick features that will transform your website into a tool which serves those goals.

Here are some to consider.

  <tr>
    <td>Info about you</td>
    <td>Almost every website will have this. Consider adding your name, phone number and other contact info, social media links, a map to your business, your experience, and anything else about you that would interest your customers.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Info about your offerings</td>
    <td>What products and services do you offer?</td>

  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Content</td>
    <td>What information would your customers find interesting?  Meaty and meaningful information is a great way to drive potential customers to your website, because search engines might correlate their search queries with your content.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Subscriber Content</td>
    <td>You could have content that is only available to members, such as those who have joined your community, or perhaps paid for access.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Comments</td>
    <td>Allow your visitors to comment on your content, which keeps them on your site longer, and encourages them to engage with you and each other.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Q&amp;A Support / FAQ</td>
    <td>Let your customers ask their questions right on your site and provide targeted responses. Determine which ones are asked the most and call them out as FAQs to proactively help new customers.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Forums</td>
    <td>Add a full-fledged discussion forum to build a community where your customers can come and discuss topics related to your business.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Support System</td>
    <td>Integrate a ticketing system where users can log support requests. This can help you manage your support and keep track of support related activities. It also encourages your customers to return to your website.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Newsletters</td>
    <td>Have users sign up for newsletters, perhaps sent by email. Let them view past newsletters on the website, either as content or subscriber content.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Events and Appointments</td>
    <td>Integrate calendars and events into your website as another way to engage with them.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Do you have special requirements for how your visitors can use your website?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Multiple Languages</td>
    <td>Support a more diverse set of people. Would culture-specific content be appropriate?</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>A/B Testing</td>
    <td>Can you integrate testing into your website so you can learn from your visitors?</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Affiliates</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Others?</td>
    <td>This list is just the beginning. Look at other websites, particularly those in the same industry as yours.  Are the successful ones doing something that yours should do?</td>

## The Plan

Given all the features that you might want, it's not uncommon to feel a little overwhelmed.  Relax.  Take a deep breath. Then, just start. While there are many ways to build a website, [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is a very good option for new startups, especially if you are not overly-technical.  There are other similar tools, such as [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) if you like them more.  Each of these are open source, which means they are free to use.  However, you will need to pay a hosting company to run the software on a server somewhere.  Also, you'll need [a domain name](/startup-domain-name/). 

Another important benefit of tools like these is that they can be extended with plugins.  You can pick and choose the right set of plugins to get the website features that you want. WordPress, Joomla and Drupal each have a marketplace where you can get free and affordable extensions. There are even companies like [wpmudev](http://premium.wpmudev.org/) that offer a wide assortment of plugins that supposedly work well together for one price. 

Start with a minimal set of functionality.  Learn it. Get comfortable with it. Then, begin looking for the right extensions.  Ask colleagues what plugins they use. Join local meetups.  Read blogs and opinion pieces.  The tools are there for you, and they're not very expensive, nor very complicated.  You just need to get started.
